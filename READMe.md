# Laura's Flora and Fauna - JS and CSS

This website was created to practice my foundational JS and CSS skills. Many thanks to John Smilga from UDEMY for a creating a thorough course, it was a joy to follow. For CSS thank you to Maximilien Schwarzmueller for his clear and easy-to follow course on Udemy.

I thoroughly enjoyed demonstrating my progress, and being able to take my time to deeply understand CSS and JS concepts.

# Description

In this website you can find a catch-all demostration of my multiple JS and CSS projects, showcasing my progress after finishing a 6 month full-stack bootcamp.
